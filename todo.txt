After implementing functionality, work on these:

heroSelect.html is not used, implement the functionality or remove it altogether

>>>Generally just clean up the JavaScript to look more professional

The formatting for the roster.html page is bad, move it into a grid similar to the index.html page at some point

Generating the rarityString is possible, but if you want to change one thing in the string, you would need to either remember the specific point that 
a given hero is located at in the string, or manually re-enter every single hero with the single change. This is inefficient and time-wasting. 
Implement the ability to edit an existing rarityString, make string generation page automatically load stored string in cookies

Rework navbar to be reused across each page instead of having it individually added to each page

Save rarityString in browser cookies so that manual entry is not required after generating?

Replace onclick with event listeners

More elegant solution than generating the hero array in both generateHeroes and generateRarityString separately, could cause issues with one being updated and the other not, fix this
