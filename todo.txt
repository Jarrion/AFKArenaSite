After implementing functionality, work on these:

Generating the array for heroes across multiple files is wasteful and could cause problems if one is not the same as the other, fix this

The formatting for the roster.html page is terrible, move it into a grid similar to the index.html page at some point

heroSelect.html is not used, implement the functionality or remove it altogether

>>>Generally just clean up the JavaScript to look more professional
