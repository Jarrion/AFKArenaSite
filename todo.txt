After implementing functionality, work on these:

Generating the array for heroes across multiple files is wasteful and could cause problems if one is not the same as the other, fix this

--->--->--->--->---> COMPLETED --->--->--->--->---> The formatting for the roster.html page is terrible, move it into a grid similar to the index.html page at some point

heroSelect.html is not used, implement the functionality or remove it altogether

Generating the rarityString is possible, but if you want to change one thing in the string, you would need to either remember the specific point that a given hero is located at in the string,
or manually re-enter every single hero with the single change. This is inefficient and time-wasting. 
---> Implement the ability to edit an existing rarityString

Rework navbar to be reused across each page instead of having it individually added to each page

--->--->--->--->---> IN PROGRESS --->--->--->--->--->Save rarityString in browser cookies so that manual entry is not required after generating?

>>>Generally just clean up the JavaScript to look more professional
